# [The Red Lobster Book](https://realcaptainsolaris.github.io/redbook)

I keep stuff here to remember hopefully. 
I am the real Captain Solaris and this, what i know.

This book is originally forked from the [Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/digital_garden).
A lot of the original entries by `lyz` are still in there.
